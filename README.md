## Revisiting MindScape: Behavioral and Linguistic Insights from Contextual and Generic Prompt Journaling

Functionality:
All the codes ran successfully and the results can be reproduced. However, the condition is that you have to have access to the MindScape Study Datasets (which is allowed to 
share publicly yet). Therefore, we are not sharing the datasets in this github. 

Organization and readability: 

nadiaCode: This is a folder of codes where you will find the results of the Report sections from 4.1 to 4.4.
## Notebooks

- `behavior_digitalhabit.ipynb` — Analysis of digital usage behaviors
- `behavior_physical.ipynb` — Physical activity feature analysis
- `behavior_sleep.ipynb` — Sleep behavior analysis
- `behavior_socialInt.ipynb` — Social interaction metrics
- `content.ipynb` — Journal content and linguistic analysis
- `filtering.ipynb` — Data cleaning and preprocessing
- `journal_prompt.ipynb` — Prompt categorization and analysis

## How to Run the Code

`nadiaCode` : Assuming you have the datasets in your folder, you want to run `filtering.ipynb` first. Once you have the pre-processed data and clean version of it, for 
behavioral data analysis for any of the four categories, you can just rerun the code that's shared. Make sure to have necessary libraries installed such as
